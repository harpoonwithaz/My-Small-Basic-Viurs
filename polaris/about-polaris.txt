This virus does not affect the computer in anyway and is just a scary trojan

This virus may also get flagged by windows defender or an anti virus lol so just run it from small basic if it doesnt work.

To run this viurs double click on the executable file. If it doesnt work install small basic and open the .sb file and run it from there
